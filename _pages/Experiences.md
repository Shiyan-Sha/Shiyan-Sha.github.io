Research Projects
======
<div class="col-sm-9" style="display: flex; align-items: center; padding-left: 0px; text-align: justify;">
During my undergraduate studies, I participated in several important research-oriented academic competitions, which were high-level events organised by the Urban Planning Society of China. In 2019, as a team leader, I collaborated with my teammates to win awards in both the social investigation and urban design categories. These competitions honed my skills in research, observation, analysis and drawing, and provided crucial support for my postgraduate studies.

      <i>China's urbanization emphasis on high-quality development highlights the importance of "Opening and Sharing" to rejuvenate public service facilities in large cities. Since 2018, Tianjin has opened resources such as banks to offer dining and rest services for outdoor workers, aiming to fulfill social needs through shared spaces. However, policy initiatives have shown uneven distribution over time and space, failing to fully meet workers' needs. This research examines a central urban worker port in Nankai District, Tianjin, analyzing discrepancies between workers' operational needs and the port's spatial distribution and functions. Through methods like literature review, interviews, surveys, sentiment-semantic analysis, and network analysis, it aims to propose recommendations for improving the planning and management of worker ports to enhance shared quality.</i>

      <i>In this research-based project, our team selected a historic and cultural district in Liaocheng, Shandong Province, China. We conducted an in-depth, month-long investigation, focusing on various aspects such as social structure, public spaces and economic development. Based on our findings, we proposed a 'co-creation and co-governance' micro-renewal strategy to revitalise the cultural vitality of the area.</i>
