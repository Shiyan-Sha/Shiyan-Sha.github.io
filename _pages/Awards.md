During my graduate studies, through continuous exploration, I have contributed to the publication of nearly 20 research papers in high-level international journals and conferences. Among these, I was the first author or corresponding author for 7 SCI/SSCI papers (all published in JCR Q1 journals), 1 CSSCI paper (In Chinese), and 9 international conference papers, some of which I also presented. Additionally, I have participated as a co-author in the writing and revision of several other research papers.
